## 6. Data Preparation (Using Pandas)

### Steps:

- Load dataset using `pandas`
- Check missing values
- Remove duplicates
- Convert date columns to datetime format
- Create new features:
  - Order Month
  - Order Hour
  - Delivery Duration
  - Total Revenue

## 7. Data Analysis Tasks

### Analysis Performed

- Group by food category → total sales
- Group by restaurant → average rating
- Payment method usage analysis
- Monthly revenue trend
- Delivery time vs customer rating analysis


---

## 8. Key Findings and Insights

- Most orders occur in the evening (6 PM – 9 PM).
- Fast food is the highest revenue category.
- Online payments are more popular than cash.
- Longer delivery times reduce customer ratings.
- High-rated restaurants receive more repeat orders.
